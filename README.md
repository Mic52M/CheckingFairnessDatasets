# Checking Fairness in Datasets

This repository provides a framework for assessing fairness in datasets. The goal is to identify potential biases in data distributions and decision-making processes. The project offers a structured way to analyze disparities in different groups, such as gender, race, or socio-economic status, through various fairness metrics and visualization tools.

## What This Project Does
- Analyzes datasets to detect biases in machine learning models or decision systems.
- Computes fairness metrics to quantify disparities between different groups.
- Generates visualizations to help understand patterns of bias in datasets.
- Assists researchers and practitioners in developing more equitable machine learning models.

## How It Works
The code processes a given dataset, extracts relevant attributes, and applies fairness metrics to measure potential imbalances. It then generates reports and visual representations to illustrate the findings. By highlighting discrepancies, this project helps users make informed decisions about improving dataset fairness.

## Why It Matters
Ensuring fairness in machine learning and data-driven decision-making is crucial to avoid reinforcing existing social biases. This project aims to promote transparency and accountability by providing tools to examine and mitigate biases in datasets.
